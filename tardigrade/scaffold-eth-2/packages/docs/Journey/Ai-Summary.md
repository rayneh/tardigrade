## Journey of Max Rayn and Frank: Creating the Tardigrade Project

Once upon a time, in a land far away, there were two brilliant minds named Max
Rayn and Frank. They shared a passion for blockchain technology and a vision to
create something extraordinary. Together, they embarked on a journey to build
the Tardigrade Project, a resilient multichain dynamic NFT.

Their goal was to create a dynamic cross-chain NFT that could evolve as it moved
between different chains. They envisioned a world where NFTs could transcend
boundaries and transform into something new and unique with each transfer.

The Tardigrade Project consisted of three different chains: Fuji, the Avalanche
Test Chain; Mumbai, the Polygon Test Chain; and Optimism Goerli, the Optimism
Test Chain. Each chain represented a different theme, such as landscapes,
mountains, hunters, or horned animals.

To bring their vision to life, Max and Frank needed to structure and chunk the
project into manageable tasks. They identified four key components:

1. UI/UX: They designed a user interface that would allow for cross-chain
   transfers and display the NFTs. The UI/UX included buttons for cross-chain
   transfers, a div to display the current NFT, and a button to switch networks.

2. Frontend: They implemented the UI/UX design on the frontend to provide a
   seamless and intuitive user experience.

3. Backend: They developed the backend infrastructure, which generated the NFT
   images. This involved creating an event listener to listen for transfers, a
   script to generate pictures based on current attributes, and a function to
   add the generated pictures to the chain.

4. Smart Contracts: They implemented smart contracts that would enable
   cross-chain NFT transfers. This included a transfer function and a
   cross-chain simplistic state management system.

With their plan in place, Max and Frank began their journey. They started by
defining the project's goal: to create a dynamic cross-chain NFT. They outlined
their ideas and requirements, and they wrote user stories and diagrams to
visualize the project's flow.

Next, they focused on creating the project's state. They divided this task into
smaller subtasks, such as creating a counter and sending and receiving numbers
cross-chain. They meticulously logged their progress,
